# Versioned JSON Patch
> by Tomek WytrÄ™bowicz (Starcounter)

## Abstract

Versioned JSON Patch is a defined convention to use [JSON Patch [RFC6902]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) to help applying sequences in required correct order, especially in case of asynchronous communication.

## Introduction

[JSON Patch [RFC6902]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) is a format for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to
a target JSON document. It requires to apply sequences in correct, sequential order. However, the JSON Patch spec does not suggest any way to achieve it.

Versioned JSON Patch is proposed format to specify the sequential nature of JSON Patches, and to make it more suitable for use with the asynchronous communication like HTTP PATCH, or Web Sockets. It also helps to achieve eventual consistency with [Operational Transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation).
Versioned JSON Patch is in fact fully compatible JSON Patch, so it should not provide any compatibility issues, nor additional layers.

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Single Versioned JSON Patch

JSON Patch application order can be guaranteed, by adding single version number to the JSON document.

### Document Structure

As already stated in [2. Introduction](#Introduction) Versioned JSON Patch is JSON Patch:

```json
  [
     { "op": "test", "path": "/v", "value": 1 },
     { "op": "replace", "path": "/v", "value": 2 },
     { "op": "test", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": "foo" },
     { "op": "remove", "path": "/a/b/c" },
     { "op": "add", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": [ "foo", "bar" ] },
     { "op": "replace", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": 42 },
     { "op": "move", "from": "/a/b/c", "path": "/a/b/d" },
     { "op": "copy", "from": "/a/b/d", "path": "/a/b/e" }
   ]
```
and all evaluation and application rules applies here as well.

The only difference is that peers that takes part in communication MUST agree on **version path** -  [JSON Pointer [RFC6901]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) (name and position in JSON document) to a node that will contain a **version number**, and each sequence MUST contain `test` and `replace` operation objects for this value.

```json
{ "op": "test", "path": "/v", "value": 1 },
{ "op": "replace", "path": "/v", "value": 2 }
```

> :bulb: for optimization reasons (traffic, calculations etc.) one of this operations may be omitted, if both peers agree that one implies another.
> :question: consider SHOULD

### Version

Theoretically, _version number_ could be stored in any part of a JSON tree, but it's highly RECOMENDED to keep it at root level.
It is also RECOMENDED to keep `test` and `replace` operations objects as first in JSON Patch sequence, so Patches could get rejected fast.

When a new JSON Patch is created, it MUST contain `test` operation object for current _version number_, and MUST contain `replace` operation with increased value, _version number_ it SHALL NOT get change in any other way or reason.

> :bulb: :grey_question: does sequence with test operation objects only, needs to bump version?

With such processed value, sequential application is assured by JSON Patch application algorithm.
Additionally, _version number_ can be used to implement queuing layer, that will solve conflicts related to asynchronous traffic of patches.


## Persistence of _version number_ in JSON document

In specific implementations processing of the _version number_ MAY be incorporated in communication layer and separated from JSON document operated by peers, but it could as well be visible to entire application logic, as long, as changing constraints will be respected.

# Appendix
## Examples

### Sequential flow
An example target JSON document:

```json
{ 
  "foo": "bar"
}
```
with agreed `/version` as a version path:

```json
{ 
  "version": 0,
  "foo": "bar"
}
```
Regular JSON Patch to change original document would have look like:

```json
[
 { "op": "add", "path": "/baz", "value": "qux" }
]
```
A Versioned JSON Patch

```json
[
 { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/version", "value": 1 },
 { "op": "add", "path": "/baz", "value": "qux" }
]
```

The resulting JSON document:

```json
{ 
  "version": 1,
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": "qux"
}
```


### Deep version path
An example target JSON document:

```json
{ 
  "foo": "bar"
}
```
collaboration peers agreed to keep version at `/_meta/version`:

```json
{ 
  "_meta":{
    "version": 0
  },
  "foo": "bar"
}
```
Regular JSON Patch to change original document would have look like:

```json
[
 { "op": "add", "path": "/baz", "value": "qux" }
]
```
A Versioned JSON Patch

```json
[
 { "op": "test", "path": "/_meta/version", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/_meta/version", "value": 1 },
 { "op": "add", "path": "/baz", "value": "qux" }
]
```

The resulting JSON document:

```json
{ 
  "_meta":{
    "version": 0
  },
  "foo": "bar",
  "baz": "qux"
}
```


### Order conflict detection - gap
An example target JSON document with agreed `/version` as a version path:

```json
{ 
  "version": 0,
  "guestList": ["Bob", "Thomas"]
}
```
Peer A sends two consecutive patches to the document,
A1:

```json
[
 { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/version", "value": 1 },
 { "op": "remove", "path": "/guestList/0"}
]
```
and A2:

```json
[
 { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 1 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/version", "value": 2 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/guestList/0", "value": "Tomek" }
]
```
Due to asynchronous communication, Patches comes to peer B with different order (A2, A1)

A2 will not be applied as `{ "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 1 }` rejects it.
then A1 will change the document to

```json
{ 
  "version": 0,
  "guestList": ["Thomas"]
}
```

Please note, that additional application logic may use version numbers to queue A2, and apply it later.

### Order conflict detection - collision
An example target JSON document with agreed `/version` as a version path:

```json
{ 
  "version": 0,
  "balance": 5,
  "basket": []
}
```
Peer A applies a patch to the document:

```json
[
 { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/version", "value": 1 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/balance", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "add", "path": "/basket/-", "value": "apple" }
]
```

The resulting JSON document:

```json
{ 
  "version": 1,
  "balance": 0,
  "basket": ["apple"]
}
```

In the mean time peer B also changed the document, and sends another patch:

```json
[
 { "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/version", "value": 1 },
 { "op": "replace", "path": "/balance", "value": 0 },
 { "op": "add", "path": "/basket/-", "value": "orange" }
]
```

Which will not get applied due to failing `{ "op": "test", "path": "/version", "value": 0 }`. 
Then application logic may use this patch, and version numbers to resolve conflict.
